  <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2><h4>April, 2023</h5>
<p>
  My academic interest is photography. Photography is the art of creating durable images and memories either electronically or via chemical means. Photography is a means of communicating and recording precious moments in life. As a form of art, photography captures pieces of human emotions that compel and move us, and unlike painting, photography requires a tangible object to be there. It helps keep history alive and authentic in an unchangeable form. Other forms of history keeping, like art, can be false because they are the artist's imagination, unlike photography, which captures the exact and specific event, leaving a zero percent chance of alteration. Besides history, photography helps record the happy moments in life and keeps them alive. Let's say you take a day out on the beach and see something so memorable and exciting it has to be shared; a photo is exactly what you need. Scientists take photography to document discoveries dating back to the early eighteenth century. These great minds worked with materials that caused light to stick and form permanent images. However, until the year eighteen twenty-six, a French inventor Niepce took the first-ever successful photo opening the way for others like myself.

  During my free time, I take part in photographing because it is fun and educating. With just the right angle, I have learned we can inform people of essential aspects of life like conservation of the environment, appreciation of culture, and preservation. Photography can be used as entertainment in the museum if one enjoys it. One can transform a photograph from its original form into cartoons on the original photo to entertain through modern technology. There are also other methods like taking videos which are just photographs that move and are also used in the entertainment industry. What is not known to many is that photography helps keep both the body and mind of the photographer fit and in good condition. For one, this is achieved when the photographer gets out to walk around parks and other attractive spots to find perfect moments to capture. I believe great moments need to be treasured in life, and what better way to do that than through photography. I think that photography is the key to preserving all history and the best course of passing it down to future generations while it is still intact and without it being distorted through time. Photography can also give information and news when important aspects are captured. Photography opens up new careers for the youth and can be pursued as a hobby and as a career. This may include photojournalism, event photography, and nature photography. I also believe that everyone should embrace photography and use it to tell stories that are unknown to the world. I dream of helping more people embrace photography in the way I do. I hope to find great talent in the younger generations, tell their stories and help nature grow these talents in photography. I also hope to open a more extensive branch of my photo museum to tell more stories of our country's diverse history and culture. I also hope to earn enough to start a community-based program to educate young generations on photography's fun and essential art. By this, I would be giving back to the community, which through photography, I have learned to make friends with and build strong relations.
